## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project using SASS. I applied a variety of concepts that were new to me while building this project.

- This was my first project using the 7-1 architecture which makes the CSS code more readable and maintable.
- I removed a lot of redundancy in my CSS using mixins, a SASS feature.
- I automated the conversion of px to rem using a function and "sass:math" package.

### Continued development

I plan to keep getting better at utilizing SASS for my projects.

### Useful resources

- [SASS Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/) - The best reference for SASS on the internet.
